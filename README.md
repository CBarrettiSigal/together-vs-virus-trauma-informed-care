# together-vs-virus-trauma-informed-care
Hello there! If you're reading this, you have likely been connected to our Allyship project through one of the many "Vs-Virus" Hackathons attempting to tackle Covid-19. Please be gentle, this is actually my very first React project (I'm much stronger with CSS/HTML) and I'm still learning. Perhaps you're a competent JS/ React Developer with more background in BackEnd and are willing to talk through some of the concepts I still don't have my brain around. That would be great. I know I'll get there eventually, but if we want the project to be off the ground anytime soon, help is awesome.
A few of our goals: 
Make each button an easily clickable path to resources (as I said, I'm still learning so I haven't been able to do this yet)
Implement the Clinia API (https://clinia.com/en-ca/product/search-api), for which we need to request an API-key. Someone associated with the API, maybe the author/ developer approached our team already so he would probably remember our project, we just need to pick the conversation back up.
Starting with Canada as a focus region, make the resources thorough and awesome. Then think about extending this past Canada.
For me, LEARN HOW TO DO REACT BETTER.
Thanks for giving this project a look, and hopefully chat with you soon!
